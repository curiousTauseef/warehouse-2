<P>The <STRONG>Dashboard</STRONG> module is the easiest way to display useful 
information about what is the current or past status of all the main entities in 
the current database. Using this module you can display all the information 
available to you by the reports in the Reports menu. You can easily align the 
data from different reports into separate panels and display it in the way it 
makes most sense to you<STRONG>.</STRONG></P>
<P>The <STRONG>Dashboard</STRONG> does not change any data stored in your 
system, but gives you the best way to display all the information needed for 
administration and monitoring of all the processes in your store, supermarket or 
restaurant.</P>
<P><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </B><B>Launching</B></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">To open the Dashboard window choose from the menu 
Operations-&gt;Dashboard or choose from the Settings window (Other-&gt;Settings 
or click the <IMG alt=IconSetup.png src="Pictures/IconSetup.png" width=32 height=32>&nbsp;icon) Special-&gt;Startup 
page to be Dashboard. In this case every time a user logs in the Dashboard 
window will open. This is very useful for back office computers where 
administrators or owners need to see the data they need right after they start 
their system.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" 
class=c10><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </B><B>Configuration</B></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">The first time the Dashboard module is used you 
need to configure which report data you need to be displayed and what filters 
you need to apply to it. Then you need to choose what type of visualization you 
want to use in order to display the selected data.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt" class=c13><B>2.1 Permissions</B></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c14>The first time the Dashboard is used it 
has to be configured. To do that you need to be logged with a user that has the 
�Operations-&gt;Dashboard-&gt;Edit User Interface� permission enabled at the 
�Edit-&gt;Administration-&gt;Permissions ...� menu as shown below.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c14><IMG alt=DashboardPermissions src="Pictures/DashboardPermissions.png"></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c14>The �Edit User Interface� permission 
allows the user to add, remove or edit how the report data is presented. It is a 
good practice to remove this permission for regular users that does not need 
it.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c14><IMG alt="" src="Pictures/DashBoard.png"></P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt" class=c13><B>2.2 Panels</B></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c14>To edit the Panels open the �Edit Panels� 
action tab. From there you can:</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN: 5pt 0mm 6pt 54pt" 
class=c15>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Add</B> a 
new panel to the screen. Click Add and then click on the place you want to add 
the panel. After that a screen will let you pick the report to be added. After 
you select the report and press �OK� you will see a screen that will let you 
choose all the possible filters for that report, so you can narrow the results 
as much as you want.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN: 5pt 0mm 6pt 54pt" 
class=c15>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Remove</B> 
a panel. Remove a panel by clicking �Remove� and then clicking on the panel that 
needs to be removed.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN: 5pt 0mm 6pt 54pt" 
class=c15>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Move</B> a 
panel. Move or reorganize a panel by clicking �Move� and then dragging the panel 
to move it to the desired location.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN: 5pt 0mm 6pt 54pt" 
class=c15>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Resize</B> 
a panel. Resize a panel by clicking �Resize�, and then change the size of the 
panels you want by dragging them to the desired size.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN: 5pt 0mm 6pt 54pt" 
class=c15>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Filter</B> 
- Change the panel�s filtering options by clicking �Filter�, and then changing 
the filters available for that report.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN: 5pt 0mm 6pt 54pt" 
class=c15>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>View</B> - 
Change the panel�s visualization options by pressing �View�, and then changing 
the available visualization options. You can choose from the different 
visualization types and change their options in order to display the data you 
need and exactly the way you want it to look like. The available options for 
visualization are:</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN: 5pt 0mm 6pt 54pt" class=c15 
align=left><IMG alt="" src="Pictures/DBSettings.png"></P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN: 5pt 0mm 6pt 72pt" class=c15><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Table view (the standard view for the reports). You can choose only the 
columns you want displayed so they fit better on the panel size you choose. You 
can also choose to have the column totals calculated and displayed at the bottom 
of the table. Another handy option is to select a custom refresh interval for 
this panel so it refreshes automatically regardless if a global refresh for all 
the panels is specified.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN: 5pt 0mm 6pt 72pt" class=c15><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Bar view (a total of 8 styles for displaying data). Display a Bar chart 
by choosing a column to be used as criteria for grouping together rows from the 
report result, and one or more value columns to be used for collecting value 
information that will be summed for all the rows with the same group column. 
Bars in the Bar chart represent all the groups and their size depends on the 
summed values of all the rows in that group. If you have selected a column for 
grouping which contains date information you have also the option to group 
together the rows that are within the same day, month or year. Another available 
option in this case is to choose an overlap mode which allows you to stack 
together groups that are in the same month or year. This is a very handy option 
to compare statistic information. Another page with settings allows you to 
choose the style of the bar chart and the 3D look that best fits your needs. You 
can also choose if you want a legend to be displayed and its position. Another 
handy option is to select a custom refresh interval for this panel so it 
refreshes automatically regardless if a global refresh for all the panels is 
specified.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN: 5pt 0mm 6pt 72pt" class=c15><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Pie view (display a pie chart). Display a Pie chart by choosing a group 
column to be used as criteria for grouping together rows from the report result, 
and a value column to be used for collecting value information that will be 
summed for all the rows with the same group column. Slices in the pie chart 
represent all the groups and their size depends on the summed values of all the 
rows in that group. Another page with settings allows you to choose the style of 
the pie chart and the 3D look that best fits your needs. You can also choose if 
you want a legend to be displayed and its position. Another handy option is to 
select a custom refresh interval for this panel so it refreshes automatically 
regardless if a global refresh for all the panels is specified.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt" class=c13><B>2.3 Editing the grid</B></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c14>Another action tab available is called 
�Edit Grid�. Inside that tab there are controls to change the width and the 
height of the respective grid.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c15>In the window this will change the number 
of spots shown on the screen. This way the space shown can be adjusted so if you 
want to put more panels you can increase the size if you want to make the panels 
bigger and you don�t have many panels you can make the grid smaller by reducing 
the number of rows or columns.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c15><IMG alt="" src="Pictures/DBEditGrid.png"></P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" 
class=c10><B>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </B><B>Usage</B></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt" class=c17>Once the Dashboard module is configured a 
regular user which does not have the �Edit User Interface� permission can enter 
the module and start working. When a user does not have the �Edit User 
Interface� permission enabled the action tabs �Edit Panels� and �Edit Grid� will 
not be present. This way the user interface is safe from accidental changes and 
the confusion for users that does not need this functionality is minimized.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt" class=c17><IMG alt="" src="Pictures/DBPanels.png"></P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt" class=c18><B>3.1 Refreshing panels</B></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c19>To refresh all panels with the latest 
information in the system press the �Refresh� button in the �Panels� action tab. 
This action will update all the panels so you can get the latest results 
available without the need to restart the dashboard.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt" class=c18><B>3.2 Auto refreshing panels</B></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c19>To refresh all the panels periodically 
press the �Auto refresh� button in the �Panels� action tab and select a refresh 
interval. This action will allow the dashboard to auto refresh all its panels so 
you will not need to do this manually. All the panels will be refreshed in the 
specified interval except the ones with a custom refresh interval (the custom 
refresh interval can be selected by pressing �View� in the �Edit panels� action 
tab and pressing the panel and then selecting custom refresh in the �Refresh� 
tab). This way you can refresh all the panels on a given interval and let some 
of the panels refresh on a bigger interval (because they are slower to refresh 
or not likely to change that often) or on a smaller interval (because they are 
quick to execute and likely to change frequently).</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c19>To disable Auto refreshing for all the 
panels accept the ones with custom refresh press the button �Auto refresh� 
again.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt" class=c19><B>Note:</B> Refreshing the panels too 
often can cause overall downgrade of the performance of the whole point of sale 
network.</P>
