<P>The <STRONG>Touch Screen</STRONG> module is the easiest way to make sales 
from a touch screen device. Using this module you can prepare a sale by first 
selecting the location at which the sale will take place. Then select the 
customer (partner) to which the items will be transferred, and then select the 
items that will be transferred. The usage of this module is very similar to the 
usage of the <A href="Sale.html">Sales</A> screen, but 
it is much more convenient to use in restaurant or small shops environments 
where sales must be done quickly and without the use of a keyboard.</P>
<P>Touch Screen decreases quantities of chosen items in you warehouse and 
transfers them to the customer. The operation is completed by payment and 
issuing of a document. The operation represents the accounting term 
�Expenses�.</P>

</B><B>Launching</B></P>
<P>To open the Touch Screen window choose from the menu Operations-&gt;Touch 
Screen or choose from the Settings window (Other-&gt;Settings or click the <IMG alt=IconSetup.png src="Pictures/IconSetup.png" width=32 height=32 v:shapes="Picture_x0020_2">&nbsp;icon) 
Special-&gt;Startup page to be Touch Screen. This way every time a user logs in 
the Touch Screen window will open. This is very useful for restaurants where 
many people use the same device and need to log in and out of the system 
frequently.<B></B></P>
<P 
style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</B><B>Configuration</B></P>
<P>The first time the Touch Screen module is used you need to configure it with 
which locations, customers (partners), and items the touch screen will be 
working. The entities chosen will represent the sub set of all the available 
entities in the system that will be used. There is no practical limitation on 
how many of each of these entities can be used.</P>
<P

</B><B>Permissions</B></P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 58.5pt">The first time the Touch 
Screen is used it has to be configured. To do that you need to be logged with a 
user that has the �Operations-&gt;Touch Screen-&gt;Edit User Interface� 
permission enabled at the �Edit-&gt;Administration-&gt;Permissions ...� menu as 
shown below.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 58.5pt"><IMG alt=TouchScreenPermissions.png src="Pictures/TouchScreenPermissions.png" v:shapes="_x0000_s1040"></P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 58.5pt">The �Edit User Interface� 
permission allows the user to add, remove or edit how the Locations, Customers 
and Items are presented. It is a good practise to remove this permission for 
regular users that does not need it.</P>

<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 58.5pt">To edit the Locations open 
the �Edit Locations� action tab. From there you can:</P>

<B>Add</B> new location to the screen. Click Add and then click on the place you 
want to add the location(s). After that a screen will let you pick the 
location(s) you want to be added or create a new one and then choose it.</P>

style="TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 58.5pt">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<B>Create a Location Group</B>. Create a location group out of a location by 
clicking �Create Group� and clicking on a location that you want to be converted 
to a group. This is useful for restaurants where you usually have one location 
(the restaurant itself) and many tables. This way you can enter the group and a 
new space will be open where the locations representing the tables can be added. 
The bigger benefit here is that orders can be placed on each table but when they 
are finished they are converted to sales and the location for the sale is the 
location group at the beginning. This way the stock quantities and availability 
doesn�t need to be tracked per table but per the restaurant. Location groups can 
also be nested within each other. This is useful for scenarios like a restaurant 
with two or more floors where you have a root group (the restaurant) and then a 
group inside it for each floor and then locations in each floor group for each 
table.</P>

the location being removed must be finished or cancelled before removing the

itself.</P>

using the resize panel in the action tab.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 58.5pt">To continue to the

regular user which does not have the �Edit User Interface� permission can enter 
the module and start working. When a user does not have the �Edit User 
Interface� permission enabled the action tabs �Edit Locations�, �Edit 
Customers�, �Edit Items� and �Edit Grid� will not be present. This way the user 
interface is safe from accidental changes and the confusion for users that does 
not need this functionality is minimized.</P>

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">The first thing that needs to be selected is which 
location will be used for the operation.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">If you have the option in the settings window 
�Auto choose single locations� and there is only one location it is 
automatically selected and the user is forwarded to the next screen, to choose a 
customer. This is very useful for small shops that are making sales on behalf of 
only one location and does not need to choose it every time the user logs 
in.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">If there is a single location group on the main 
screen and the option �Auto choose single locations� enabled in the settings 
window the location group will be automatically entered and the locations that 
are in it will be shown instead of showing a screen with only one location 
group. This is a useful function for restaurants that have a location group for 
the restaurant and locations in it that represent the tables, or optionally two 
or more location groups for each floor with locations in them for the tables on 
each of the floors.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><B>Note:</B> If there is an order already placed 
on a location and the currently logged user can see it (it is either ordered by 
the current user or the current user has the �Manage Operators� permission set) 
then the location will be marked with the partner icon&nbsp;<IMG alt=Partner16.png src="Pictures/Partner16.png" width=16 height=16 v:shapes="_x0000_s1038">.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">After the location is selected the next step is to

back to the item group that contains the current group you can do that by 
pressing the tab representing the name of the group located below the items.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">If the option �Combine operation details while 
ordering� is enabled then when pressing on an item button multiple times the 
items will be combined in to a single order detail and only the quantity of the 
items ordered will be increased. If the option �Combine operation details while

detail will be created.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><B>Note: </B>If the operation contains items from 
previous orders and the user orders of the same item again the items will not be 
combined with the items ordered before even if the �Combine operation details 
while ordering� option is enabled. The reason for this is to make sure that if 
the user has printed a non fiscal receipt for the saved order and he prints a 
new non fiscal receipt for the newly ordered items the new non fiscal receipt 
will not contain already printed items. This will guarantee that the sum of all 
the non fiscal receipts is not greater than the operation total.</P>
